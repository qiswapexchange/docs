# How to install QiWallet on Google Chrome

For the first QiSwap Testnet, we will need to install QiWallet manually on Google Chrome. This won't be necessary when QiWallet is listed on the Chrome marketplace.

For the time being, let's follow these instructions to install QiWallet on Google Chrome and use it for the QiSwap Testnet.

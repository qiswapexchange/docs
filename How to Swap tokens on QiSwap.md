# How to Swap tokens on QiSwap



#### Swapping tokens is quick and easy on QiSwap, the platform runs on the Qtum blockhain which allows users to benefit from low fees and fast transaction times. We have also put together a nice and clean interface to make life easier for our users.

First, we need to make sure to click on **"Launch Swap"**

For this tutorial, we'll swap tokens between "Test-1" and "Test-2" We input the amount to swap (10 Test-1). The platform automatically shows the total in "Test-2" as well as other details regarding the transaction.

After entering the balance and clicking on **"Swap"** we get a <u>"Confirm Transaction"</u> screen. We just need to verfiy the information and scroll down to click on **"Confirm"**

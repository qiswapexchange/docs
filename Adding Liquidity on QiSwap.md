# Adding Liquidity on QiSwap



#### Adding liquidity is just as easy as Swapping tokens on QiSwap.

We now go to **"Pool"** and select the tokens which we want to add liquidity for. Once we've selected the tokens, we need to enter the amounts to add to the liquidity pool. 

When done, click on **"Add Liquidity"**

Once we click, the **Confirm Transaction** screen will show. Then we need to click on **"Confirm"**

The transaction has now been sent and is being confirmed. Just like in Swap, we can see the **"Add Liquidity"** button turning grey. Once it's confirmed, the button will turn purple.
